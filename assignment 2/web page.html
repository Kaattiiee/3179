					<p>Australia, a country renowned for its rich and diverse tourism offerings, 
						attracting millions of travellers each year. Between 2017 and 2025, 
						Australia's tourism experienced both growth and challenges. In 2021, the 
						COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp decline in international travel, affecting 
						both inbound and outbound travelling. However, the industry is recovering
						in the years followed and returning to levels close to those before the pandemic.

						Between March 2024 and March 2025, a total of almost 5 million tourists visited Australia.
						Among the recorded countries of residence, over 8 hundred thousand tourists were from New Zealand,
						followed by China with more than 480,000 tourists. The total spending of these tourists while in Australia 
						was also recorded. Tourists from China spent the most with over 7 billion dollars, followed by tourists
						from the USA, who spent over 3 billion dollars. While China contributed both a large number of tourists and the 
						highest total spending, New Zealand tourists spent less on average despite their large numbers.

						Tourist spending generally increases with the length of stay, but patterns vary by market. 
						Tourists from China stand out with the highest spending despite moderate stays, reflecting 
						their strong spending on shopping and experiences. In contrast, visitors from New Zealand tend to 
						have more visits but spend less on average. In addition, tourists from the USA and UK combine long 
						visits and high spendings, making them key contributors to Australia's tourism industry.

						China and Japan, seasonal peak occurs during holiday periods such as Lunar New Year and summer 
						vacations. European countries tend to have more visitors during the Norther Hemisphere's winter
						months, aligning with Australia's summer season.

						Among Australians who travelled internationally, the regional distribution of departures highlights
						where the majority of tourists travel from in Australia. Unsurprisingly, New South Wales and Victoria as 
						Australia's most popular states, recorded the highest numbers of outbound tourists. This reflects not 
						only their large population, but also their international connectivity with major flight routes. Other states
						and territories contribute smaller shares, highlighted the significant role NSW and Vic play in facilitating 
						Australia's outbound travel.

						Travel destinations for Australians also vary by season. Similar to inbound tourism, New Zealand remains a 
						consistently popular destination throughout the year. Canada, with its opposite seasons to Australia, attracts 
						many tourists seeking different weather condition abroad. Other destinations across Europe and Asia, such as the UK, 
						Japan, Thailand and China, also receive a significant number of Australian tourists, reflecting a diverse 
						travel interests for Australians.

						Overall, Australia's outbound spending consistently exceeds inbound spending, indicating Australian tourists 
						spend more abroad than the country earns from inbound tourists each year. The steady increase of spendings from 2016 had a 
						slight decrease in 2019, followed by a sharp drop in 2020. Both inbound and outbound spend fell significantly, 
						reflecting the impact of internation travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
						After the pandemic, the spendings were continuously increasing, signaling economic recovery across all countries.

						Education services, a major source of income for Australia, rely heavily on international students
						coming into the country to study. Alongside education, rental income from vacation homes 
						has also became a significant contributor. For short-term tourists, categories such as accommodation services, 
						food and beverages, shopping, gifts and souvenirs are more representiative of their spending areas. 
						However, education services and vacation home rentals dominated international visitor expenditures including both
						long-term visitors and tourists.

						Although inbound tourists spent less than outbound tourists, they contributed signficantly to
						employment in tourism-related industries. In 2020, with reduced tourist activity, the number of jobs 
						in these industries also declined. Overall, tourism supported a large amount of jobs, 
						with Accommodation, Retail trade and Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services sectors employing 
						the most. A large number of filled positions can potentially indicate stronger economic benefits 
						for Australia.
