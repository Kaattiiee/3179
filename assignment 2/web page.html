					<p>Australia, a country renowned for its rich and diverse tourism offerings, 
						attracting millions of visitors each year. Between 2017 and 2025, 
						Australia's tourism experienced both growth and challenges. In 2021, the 
						COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp decline in international travel, affecting 
						both inbound and outbound travellers. However, the industry is recovering
						in the years followed and returning to levels close to those before the pandemic.

						Between March 2024 and March 2025, a total of almost 5 million tourists visited Australia.
						Among the recorded countries of residence, over 8 hundred thousand tourists were from New Zealand,
						followed by China with more than 480,000 tourists. The total spending of these tourists while in Australia 
						was also recorded. Tourists from China spent the most -over 7 billion dollars- followed by tourists
						from the USA, who spent over 3 billion dollars. While China contributed both a large number of tourists and the 
						highest total spending, New Zealand tourists spent less on average despite their large numbers.

						Tourist spending generally increases with the length of stay, but patterns vary by market. 
						Tourists from China stand out with the highest spending despite moderate stays, reflecting 
						strong spending on shopping and experiences. In contrast, visitors from New Zealand tend to 
						have more visits but spend less on average. In addition, tourists from the USA and UK combine long 
						visits and high spendings, making them key contributors to Australia's tourism industry.

						Travel peaks also varies from country to country. Countries near Australia like New Zealand 
						has relatively consistent tourist arrivals throughout the year. For Asian countries, particularly
						China and Japan, seasonal peak occurs during holiday periods such as Lunar New Year and summer 
						vacations. European countries tend to have more visitors during the Norther Hemisphere's winter
						months, aligning with Australia's summer season.
