					<p>Between March 2024 and March 2025, a total of 7 million tourists visited Australia.
						Among the recorded countries of residence, over 1 million tourists were from New Zealand,
						followed by China with more than 600,000 tourists. The total spending of these tourists while in Australia 
						was also recorded. Tourists from China spent the most -over 11 billion dollars- followed by tourists
						from the USA, who spent almost 5 billion dollars. While China contributed both a large number of tourists and the 
						highest total spending, New Zealand tourists spent less on average despite their large numbers.

					<h2>Number of Tourists VS Total spend</h2>
					<p>The number of tourists from a country often has strong relationship with the total spending by visitors from 
						that country. Generally, a higher number of tourists corresponds to higher overall spending in Australia.
						However, China and New Zealand stand out as notable exceptions. China, despite not having the highest number
						of tourists, accounts for the largest total spending, indicating that Chinese visitors spend more per person 
						on avergae, likely due to longer stays or participation in high-value tourism activities. While tourists from
						New Zealand may had shorter visits and therefore lower spending per person.
